# Smart Contract for buying & selling Real Estate üè°

## What does this contract do and why was it created?
This smart contract aims to eliminate many middlemen and third parties in real estate purchases and sales, to minimize fees such as extra approval and commission that buyers and sellers have to pay, and to create a more reliable environment during money exchange.

It's also my final case for [Paribu Hub Smart Contract Practicum](https://www.patika.dev/web3/paribu-hub-akilli-sozlesme-solidity-practicum).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è How can you run this ? 
I used **Remix IDE**  to build and test my smart contract. You can go to [remix.ethereum.org](remix.ethereum.org), then create a workspace using default template. After that paste the code in my contract folder into the .sol file. Lastly you can compile and deploy it.
